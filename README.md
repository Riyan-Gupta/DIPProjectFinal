# DIPProjectFinal
So this project is about the use of hybrid models in order to classify the plant samples as either healthy or diseased. We have used the CCMT dataset as the data to use our models on.This project is basically a test of the hybrid models in comparison to the performance of the singular models like SVM etc.
